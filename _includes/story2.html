	<h1>Engagement</h1>
	<p><i>Gabriel:</i> Near Arab street in Singapore there's a bar with a theme. Constructed in the early 2000's by an aging property businessman as a <i>price-is-no-object</i> statement, the d√©cor is strictly art deco and the fairy servers get your wine bottles by flying.</p>
	<p>We'd been many times, and I didn't suspect a thing when it came up as a good spot for a nightcap to finish our evening out and about. And so it came to pass that I was proposed to in a place both ephemeral yet timeless, and both fantastic and formidable.</p>
