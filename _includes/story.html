		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<p>I met Gabriel in 2011 through the Spotify climbing group. Together with Emil Fredriksson we launched <i>Föreningen för Söndagmiddagens bevarande</i>, giving Gabriel weekly opportunities to impress me with his top notch cooking and handmade cocktails.. One and a half year later we went public, to the great surprise of Gabriels flat mate Carl-Axel Larsen. To seal our commitment, we took off on a 3 week trip to Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras to experience the 'Once every 7885 years' Maya Universe Calendar Doomsday ending in December 2012. </p>
